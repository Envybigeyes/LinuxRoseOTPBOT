# LinuxRoseOTPBOT
This is LinuxRose, and my version of an OTPBOT, after finding it so hard to find a free and easily accessible OTPBOT for pentesting and Phishing Purposes, I created my own. Please feel free to make suggestions, create issues, and please email me or leave a comment if you find error with my project, or can make it better. *disclaimer* First Project!
